This is a special distribution of msn-pecan + libpurple + telepathy-haze; all
in one.

So you get to use msn-pecan through telepathy without any dependencies.

You'll need:
 * msn-pecan 0.1.0
 * libpurple-mini 2.7.1
 * telepathy-haze 0.3.4

Other versions would probably work, but you might need to do small modifications.

You'll need to place them in a single directory, and then do:
 % export TP_PECAN=mydir

Then, back here:
 % make copy
 % make prefix=/opt/tp-pecan ssl_dir=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ install

Note: the location of certs might be different on your distro.

To run:
 % HAZE_PERSIST=1 /opt/tp-pecan/libexec/telepathy-pecan

You should find the 'msn-pecan' option in Empathy now.
